# Pandas Projects

This folder contains standalone **Pandas projects** that showcase my ability to clean, analyze, and manipulate data using Python. Each project demonstrates my proficiency in working with structured datasets, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deriving meaningful insights using Pandas.

## Projects

1. **Airbnb Data Analysis**
   - **Description**: This project analyzes Airbnb listings data to uncover pricing trends, neighborhood popularity, and property characteristics. It also includes automation to handle multiple city datasets efficiently.
   - **Target Audience**: The analysis is useful for travelers, Airbnb hosts, and real estate investors looking to understand market trends.
   - **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
   - **Folder**: `AirBnN-Analysis/`

2. **Ecommerce-Sales-Analysis**
   - **Description**: This project explores a sales dataset to identify top-selling products, seasonal trends, and revenue distribution across different regions.
   - **Target Audience**: Business analysts, sales managers, and marketers aiming to optimize sales strategies and inventory management.
   - **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
   - **Folder**: `Sales-Data-Analysis/`

## How to Use This Folder
- Each project folder contains:
  - A `README.md` with detailed project information.
  - Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) containing the analysis code.
  - Datasets used for the analysis (if publicly available).

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Pandas**: Data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends, correlations, and insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating meaningful charts and graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Business Intelligence**: Extracting actionable insights to support decision-making.
