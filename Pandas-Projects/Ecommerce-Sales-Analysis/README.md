## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main components:

### **1. Data Loading**
**Objective**: Read and structure the dataset for analysis.  
**Key Steps**:
- Import necessary libraries.
- Load sales data into Pandas DataFrame.

### **2. Data Cleaning**
**Objective**: Ensure data quality before performing analysis.  
**Key Steps**:
- Handle missing or inconsistent values.
- Convert data types for accurate analysis.
- Standardize column names.

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
**Objective**: Extract key insights from sales data.  
**Key Analyses**:
- **Sales Performance**: Total revenue, best-selling products, and seasonal trends.
- **Time-Based Analysis**: Identifying peak sales periods and growth patterns.
- **Location-Based Analysis**: Analyzing sales distribution across different regions.

**Files**:
- `sales.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis.
