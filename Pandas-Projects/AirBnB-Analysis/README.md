# Airbnb Data Analysis and Automation - Python Project

This project analyzes **Airbnb listings data** to uncover insights into pricing trends, neighborhood popularity, and property characteristics. Additionally, it automates the analysis process to handle multiple cities efficiently. The project involves:

- **Data Exploration**: Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnb listings.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, transforming data, and standardizing formats.
- **Automation**: Creating reusable functions to apply the analysis to different cities.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main components:

### **1. Data Exploration (Paris Airbnb Listings)**

**Objective**: Analyze Paris Airbnb data to extract key insights.\
**Key Analyses**:

- **Price Distribution**: Understanding pricing patterns and outliers.
- **Neighborhood Popularity**: Identifying high-demand areas.
- **Property Characteristics**: Examining room types, availability, and host activity.

**Files**:

- `Airbnb (Paris).ipynb`

### **2. Automation for Multiple Cities**

**Objective**: Create a reusable function to analyze Airbnb data from different cities.\
**Key Features**:

- **Dynamic Data Loading**: Reads datasets based on user input.
- **Automated Data Cleaning**: Standardizes missing values, formats, and column structures.
- **Consistent EDA**: Generates key insights and visualizations for any city dataset.

**Files**:

- `AirBnB.ipynb`
