## Key Features of the Analysis and Visualization  

### **Data Cleaning and Preparation**  
- Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.  
- Extracted key metrics such as **positive test rates** and **death-to-case ratios** for deeper analysis.  
- Segmented data by country, age group, and time period for more detailed insights.  

### **COVID-19 Case and Mortality Insights**  
- Tracked **total cases, deaths, and death ratios** over time.  
- Analyzed **fatality rates by age group**, highlighting vulnerable populations.  
- Identified **countries with the highest case and death counts** to assess regional impact.  

### **Testing and Vaccination Trends**  
- Examined **total tests conducted** and **positive test rates** across countries.  
- Assessed **vaccination progress** by tracking fully vaccinated individuals worldwide.  
- Identified **high-risk areas** with low vaccination rates and high case numbers.  

### **Time-Based Trends and Forecasting**  
- Visualized **COVID-19 case trends over time** to identify peak infection periods.  
- Examined seasonal patterns in case surges and vaccination drives.  
- Evaluated the impact of lockdowns and government interventions.
